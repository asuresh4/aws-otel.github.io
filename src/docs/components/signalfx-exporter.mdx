## Overview

The [`signalfx` exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/signalfxexporter) exports metrics, events and trace correlation to Splunk Infrastrcuture Monitoring.

## Configuring SignalFx Exporter

Here is a simple configuration for exporting metrics using the `signalfx` exporter.

```yaml
exporters:
  signalfx:
    access_token: YOUR_TOKEN
    realm: us0
```

The `realm` configuration option determines the destination to which data will be sent. The access token can be obtained from the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring web. For details on how to do so please refer the documentation [here](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/tokens.html#access-tokens).

To send metrics compatible to the ones emitted by the [SignalFx Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/), set the `send_compatible_metrics` to `true`. Also, ensure `translation_rules` are not explicitly specified, if not, the defaults will not be used. Here is an example to exporter compatible metrics from the `hostmetrics` receiver.

```yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 10s
    cpu:
    memory:
    network:
    disk:
exporters:
  signalfx:
    access_token: YOUR_TOKEN
    realm: us0
    send_compatible_metrics: true
```

For more details on all configuration options refer to the [`open-telemetry` GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/signalfxexporter).
